				<p>Here are some projects that I'm currently working on or have already finished!</p>
				<h2>Completed</h2>
					<div id = "completed">
						<ul>
							<li>Minecraft Server</li>
								<div class = "desc">
									<p>So when I was in fourth grade, Minecraft was a pretty popular game. All of my fiends played it. We only had one problem which was playing on the same server. Public servers worked, but we had to deal with other people and we didn't have the power to control the server. I eventualy learned how to create a server and made a Vanilla server that we could all play on.</p>
									<p>Eventually my server stopped working. After a while I decided to remake my server. I decided I would create a Bukkit server. This type of server was more interesting due to the fact that it could support plug-ins that could change game play.</p>
								</div>
							<li>Minecraft Mod</li>
								<div class = "desc">
									<p>I usually have a project for myself every summer since I rarely travel, so in summer of 2014, I started to make a Minecraft mod.</p>
								</div>
							<li>Roll A Ball (Unity Tutorial)</li>
								<div class = "desc">
									<p>I've always been interested in video games, so in summer of 2015, I decided to make my own. I started with this tutorial because it was the simplest.</p>
								</div>
							<li>Space Shooter (Unity Tutorial)</li>
								<div class = "desc">
									<p>This was the second Unity tutorial I did. However, there was no tutorial on how to make the enemy, so I coded it by myself using what knowledge of C# I had gained from the tutorial.</p>
								</div>
							<li>Raspberry Pi Computer</li>
								<div class = "desc">
									<p>During summer of 2015, I got a Raspberry Pi. I built and set it up, but ended up breaking it so I'll work onf fixing it this summer (2016).</p>
								</div>
						</ul>
					</div>
				<h2>Works in Progress</h2>
					<div id = "wip">
						<ul>
							<li>Falcon 9 Model</li>
								<div class = "desc">
									<p>This is for a science project (2016). Our group is working on helping with SpaceX's Falcon 9. I am making a forum and website for our project while the rest of my group models and fills in content for the website. I will supplythe link once the project is closer to complete.</p>
								</div>
							<li>Raspberry Pi Game Table</li>
								<div class = "desc">
									<p>I found this design online one day and I thought I would try to make it. Since I broke my Pi, I haven't been able to work on this.</p>
								</div>
							<li>Oculus Rift Game</li>
								<div class = "desc">
									<p>I got an Oculus Rift SDK in summer 2015. I was planning on making a game, but I ended up just learning how to use Unity. I'm not quite sure what I want my game to be about yet.</p>
								</div>
						</ul>
					</div>
				<h2>Ideas</h2>
					<div id = "ideas">
						<ul>
							<li>Robotic Arm</li>
								<div class = "desc">
									<p>I'm not quite sure how this is going to work or when I'm going to start this project, but I want to make a robotic arm that goes over my left arm. I don't really know why I want to build this, but its probably because I think it will look cool.</p>
								</div>
							<li>Mental Health App</li>
								<div class = "desc">
									<p>I was learning how to develop apps this year (2016) and I decided to try to make an app that would attempt to help people who may or may not be mentally healthy.</p>
									<p>The app will have a friendly, cheerful interface. It will ask you how you're feeling today and give you a wide range of emoji-like faces that you can choose from. I think I will try to let the user input more than one face. Depending on the mood(s) you chose, it will give you some jokes, mini-games, and maybe some other things.</p>
